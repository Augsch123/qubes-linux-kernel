Subject: fs: novfs: Return ENOTEMPTY when tyring to delete a non-empty folder
References: bnc#583964
Patch-mainline: no

The patch returns the ENOTEMPTY error code, when an user issues
delete command on a non-empty folder. This fix makes Nautilus
behave correctly in novfs, just like other file-systems.
